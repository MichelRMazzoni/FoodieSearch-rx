# FoodieSearch-rx [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kuriishu27/FoodieSearch-rx.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kuriishu27/FoodieSearch-rx)
Simple application using RxSwift, RxCocoa, Moya with MVVM pattern

Using Swift Package Manager to manage dependencies for faster builds when using CI/CD.

Managing dependencies with SPM is much smoother than with Cocoapods as it didn't allow for caching the dependencies and required installing pods when using a new computer or if someone else wanted to play around with your project.

## API
The API used for retrieving the Recipes is called Recipe Puppy

It's a very simple API with just one endpoint

## MVVM architecture

MVVM stands for Model, View, View Model and Controller.
This architecture allows for better code management and reduces considerably the amount of boilerplate code.
